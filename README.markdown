TorChat
=======

TorChat is a peer to peer instant messenger with a completely decentralized design, 
built on top of Tor's location hidden services, giving you extremely strong anonymity 
while being very easy to use without the need to install or configure anything.

TorChat Revised
---------------

Because the original TorChat is very basic and is lacking usability, I decided to peek 
into the code and see if I could make some enhancements. The code is based on version
0.9.9.550 has since seen several revisions.

I have been testing the revised TorChat for a while now, and it seems perfectly stable.

It is 100% with the regular version of TorChat. It only enhances the user experience and 
brings some extra features. No changes were made to the protocols.

Maybe in a feature built an exception could be made to implement groupchats.
