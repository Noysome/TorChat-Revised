TorChat
=======

TorChat is a peer to peer instant messenger with a completely decentralized design, 
built on top of Tor's location hidden services, giving you extremely strong anonymity 
while being very easy to use without the need to install or configure anything.


TorChat Revised
---------------

Because the original TorChat is very basic and is lacking usability, I decided to peek 
into the code and see if I could make some enhancements. The code is based on version
0.9.9.550 and has since seen several revisions.

It is 100% compatible with the official version of TorChat, as it only enhances the user 
experience and brings some non-intrusive additional features. No changes were made to 
the underlying protocols.

The current stable release is 0.9.9.550.rev12 (released 2012-12-21), see the change log:

Downloads
---------

Github has deprecated the downloads section. For future releases, the binaries will 
either be found in the "downloads" folder in the source, or on an external website.
